# This is a multistage Dockerfile, because while we need the compilers et al for the build, we don't need them
# to run things. If you don't know what you're doing, it's probably a mistake to blindly hack up this file.
#
# By default, Ambassador's config and other application-specific stuff gets written to /ambassador. You can
# configure a different location for the runtime configuration elements via environment variables.
#
# Ambassador itself is installed with pip, so it ends up in /usr/bin and /usr/lib. At present, other
# executables are written into /ambassador, but we'll likely change that shortly.
#
# The base image (for everything) is defined here.
